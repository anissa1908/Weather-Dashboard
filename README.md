# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

I built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. API calls were also used to retrieve weather data for cities pulled by the user. Local storage was also used to store user inputs.

Source: [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.
